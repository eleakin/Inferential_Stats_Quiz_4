Which of the following is not required for the distribution of the sample proportion to be nearly normal?

Observations should be independent.

There should be at least 10 failures.

->Sample size should be at least 30 and the population distribution should not be extremely skewed.
Correct Response 
Recognize that the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is about the distribution of point estimates, and that given certain conditions, this distribution will be nearly normal.

In the case of the proportion the CLT tells us that if
(1) the observations in the sample are independent,

(2) the sample size is sufficiently large (checked using the success/failure condition: np≥10 and n(1−p)≥10),

then the distribution of the sample proportion will be nearly normal, centered at the true population proportion and with a standard error of p(1−p)n−−−−−√.

p^∼N(mean=p,SE=p(1−p)n−−−−−−−√)
When considering the distribution of the sample proportion, we don’t have a requirement of n ≥ 30. To determine if the sample size of categorical data is high enough, we instead check the success-failure condition.

There should be at least 10 successes.
